# Library Offense Documentation System — Readme

## Prerequisites

- XAMPP installed (includes Apache, PHP, MySQL/phpMyAdmin)
- A modern web browser

## Setup

1. Place the project folder in XAMPP's web root (e.g., `C:/xampp/htdocs/lods`).
2. Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start **Apache** and **MySQL**. - You can also click **Admin** next to MySQL or open: `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`
3. In phpMyAdmin create a new database named: `library_system` - Recommended collation: `utf8mb4_general_ci`
4. Import the provided SQL file (e.g., `database.sql`) into the `library_system` database via phpMyAdmin → Import.

## Application URL

- Open in your browser: `http://localhost/lods/` (adjust path if different)

## Default Credentials

Admin

- Email: `admin@gmail.com`
- Password: `12345`

Student

- Email: `jibrin@gmail.com`
- Password: `12345`

Note: These default passwords are insecure. Change them after first login using the app's user management or by updating the database.

## Troubleshooting

- If phpMyAdmin is unreachable, ensure Apache and MySQL are running in XAMPP.
- If import fails, check the SQL file for size limits or upload settings in phpMyAdmin.

That's all — the app should be ready after the above steps.
